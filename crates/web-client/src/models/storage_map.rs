/// An account storage map is a sparse merkle tree of depth 64.
///
/// It can be used to store a large amount of data in an account than would be otherwise possible
/// using just the account's storage slots. This works by storing the root of the map's underlying
/// SMT in one account storage slot. Each map entry is a leaf in the tree and its inclusion is
/// proven while retrieving it (e.g. via `AccountStorage::get_map_item`).
///
/// As a side-effect, this also means that _not all_ entries of the map have to be present at
/// transaction execution time in order to access or modify the map. It is sufficient if _just_ the
/// accessed/modified items are present in the advice provider.
///
/// Because the keys of the map are user-chosen and thus not necessarily uniformly distributed, the
/// tree could be imbalanced and made less efficient. To mitigate that, the keys used in the storage
/// map are hashed before they are inserted into the SMT, which creates a uniform distribution. The
/// original keys are retained in a separate map. This causes redundancy but allows for
/// introspection of the map, e.g. by querying the set of stored (original) keys which is useful in
/// debugging and explorer scenarios.
